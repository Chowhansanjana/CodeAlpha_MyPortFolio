## ðŸ“– About The Project

This is my personal  sample portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my skills, experience, and contact information as a front-end developer. The site features a clean, responsive layout with smooth navigation and an animated gradient background.

The goal of this project is to present myself professionally to potential employers, clients, and collaborators. It acts as a digital business card â€” highlighting my technical skills, providing access to my resume, and linking to my online profiles like GitHub and LinkedIn.

While the current version is static and lightweight, I plan to continuously improve it by adding sections for my projects, integrating a contact form, and optimizing accessibility and SEO.
